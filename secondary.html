        <p class="quote quote-two">There's never been a show quite like Queen at Live Aid.<br>

        <p class="quote quote-three">Queen’s set at the historic Live Aid charity concert has gone down in music legend.<br>

        <p class="main-title">A LEGENDARY CONCERT</p>
     
        <p class="main-paragraph-intro">Queen comprised of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano, and guitar), Brian May (guitar and vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums and vocals).</p>
        <p class="main-paragraph-second">Each performer that took the stage was given exactly twenty minutes each. Queen used their time to perform a six-song set that included: “Bohemian Rhapsody”, “Radio Ga Ga”, “Hammer to Fall”, “Crazy Little Thing Called Love”, “We Will Rock You”, and “We Are the Champions”. In addition to the six songs performed, Mercury also included a small section dedicated to interacting with the audience, which he often included in their sets to win over the audience.</p>
        <p class="main-paragraph-third">Other performers included in the lineup at Wembley Stadium were legends like Paul McCartney, Elton John, David Bowie, U2, and The Who. But it is Freddie Mercury's incredible comeback show with fellow Queen bandmates that has gone down in history as one of the most powerful rock performances of all time. Elton John is even said to have rushed to Mercury’s trailer after their set and said, “You bastards, you stole the show”. </p>
