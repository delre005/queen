    <p class="main-title">QUEEN AT LIVE AID</p>
    <p class="main-paragraph-intro">Queen’s performance at Live Aid on July 13th, 1985, is widely regarded as one of the greatest live performances in rock history. The Live Aid Concert was hosted to help raise funds for the famine in Ethiopia. Each band or performer was given exactly 20 minutes for their set. Freddie Mercury’s commanding state presence was a major factor in the success of Queen’s performance. He used his charismatic and energetic stage presence to work the crowd and connect with the audience.  </p>
